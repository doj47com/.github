# doj47.com

On Bluesky, reply to interesting posts and tag `@doj47.com`.

Your post should also reference a DOJ case by including:

- a CourtListener Docket URL, e.g. https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69741724/jgg-v-trump/
- a CourtListener RECAP URL, e.g. https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436.25.0.pdf

Those posts will get discovered by a bot and included in the website.

If you change your mind, you can delete your reply. The parent post will no longer show up in the website.

# Posters: how do I avoid notification spam?

Use Bluesky's mute feature if the notification spam is too much.

Mute the word `doj47.com` to avoid seeing notifications.

# Posters: what if I don't want my content re-used by this bot?

On the site, all posts are attributed to their author and link back to the source post.

If you don't want your posts collated by the bot, email me at cldellow@gmail.com and I'll write something to exclude
you.
